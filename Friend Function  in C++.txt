Note:
A friend function is a part of a class that helps to access the private or protected part of that class
The friend function is declared inside the class itself but defined outside the class.
Once the friend function is defined outside the class, then it is used in the main function with the obj_name of the class.


Syntax:
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
class class_name{
    access_specifer(private/protected):
    datatype and variable declaration;
    friend return_type function_name(class obj_name(it can be any, just for instant for the class to be used);
};
return_type(of friend_function) function_name(class obj_name(to use in here to call the class)){
    //code *where you want to use any information about class then use obj_name.whatever and then use
}
int main(){
class obj_name;
function_name(obj_name);// this will intiate to the defination of the code where it can refer to the class if needed and defined in the function
