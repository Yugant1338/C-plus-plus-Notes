Structure in C++:
Note:
Structure are written as struct struct_name{}; 
Structure helps for storing data of different data types
It is basically a array that can hold any datatype and its value
A single structure can be runned for multiple times using struct struct_name obj_name[n](:: Here n represents the number of times structure is being used with same datatype)

Structure Syntax:
#include <iostream>
struct struct_name{
   datatype1 variable1
   datatype2 variable2
   datatype3 variable3
   datatype n variable n
}objname;// this name will help to access the structure 
int main(){
   //body and use of structure as you want
   return 0;
}
Alternative use:
#include <iostream>
struct struct_name{
   datatype1 variable1
   datatype2 variable2
   datatype3 variable3
   datatype n variable n
} 
int main(){
   struct struct_name objname[n];// this name will help to access the structure and n will give the number of times it is used
   //body and use of structure as you want
   return 0;
}
