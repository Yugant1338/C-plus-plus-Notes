Using a function inside a class using C++
Note: 
Class only can be accessed with a function defined in it; 
Diretly the variables cannot be accesed outside the class; 
Only the function can be accessed outside the class which can use the variables inside the class inorder to perform some operation;
A function must contain access specifier, a function for operations, variable with their data types if any for use in function;
Variables defined outside the class can also be used in the function if the function has those datatype, Once the variable are used in class_name.function_name(variable), it will call the
class and then reach out the specific function and perform the operation mentioned in that function.
Just like a structure a class can also be runned for multiple times using this synatx: class_name class_objname[n](:: n is the number of times class should be runned)

Class Syntax:
class class_name{
    access specifier:
    datatype declaration;
    void function_name{ // function declaration.
	function defination
    }
};
int main(){
    class_name object_name;
}



  
include<iostream>
using namespace std;
class class_name{
    access_specifier:
    data type declaration;
    function declaration(whatever you want to use over here){
	function defination;    	
    }
};
int main(){
    class_name object_caller;
    //use the variables declared in the class used in function
    cin >> object_caller.variable;//(for user input)
    object_caller.function_name(variable used in function);
    return 0;
}
